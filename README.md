# TreeRL: LLM Reinforcement Learning with On-Policy Tree Search

Implementation for ACL'25 paper [TreeRL: LLM Reinforcement Learning with On-Policy Tree Search](). The implementation is based on [OpenRLHF]()

TreeRL is a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for training, eliminating the need for separate reward model training while providing better exploration of reasoning space through strategic branching from high-uncertainty steps. Experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TreeRL can achieve consistent better performance than ChainRL under the same expeeriment setting.

## Getting Started

Currently, we provide the following code of PRIME, you can find more details in each directory.

- `scripts` provides the script to start the training. And the RL implemenration is in `openrlhf`.
- [EPTree](openrlhf/trainer/ppo_utils/entropy_chain_local_manager.py): the tree sampling implementation.
- The training data can be found in `datasets`(datasets). We use the data from [T1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/THUDM/T1) for SFT.
